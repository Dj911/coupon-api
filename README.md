# Coupon Code API

This is a simple project where you can add Coupons and fetch those coupons based on location.

# Folder Structure

Here I have used a components folder structure. I have divided the components into 4 different structure: Routes (Router file), Controller (Fetch data from client), Services (Business Logic) and Model (Mongodb Schema)

# Utilities

I have used Winston to log all the different events and error which makes it easy to trace the flow. For security I have used cors and helmet npm packages

NODE v16.13.1
NPM v8.3.0
